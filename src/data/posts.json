Some of these may become features on this site if they make sense to add, while others will be purely for fun and learning.</p><h4>Planned Upcoming Features:</h4><ul><li><b>Sharable Filtered Pages:</b> Enable filters to work with search parameters, allowing filtered pages to be shared.</li><li><b>Light/Dark Mode:</b> Implement a toggle for light and dark modes.</li><li><b>Enhanced Styling:</b> Add icons to improve the siteâ€™s design.</li><li><b>Collapsible Action Button:</b> Introduce a collapsible action button with filtering options.</li><li><b>Loading and Pagination:</b> Implement loading and paginated posts if needed.</li></ul><p>Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to develop and improve this site.</p>",
